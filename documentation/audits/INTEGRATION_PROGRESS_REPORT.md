## 🔴 Critical Gaps Addressed from Audit

### Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ **NetworkManager Completely Unused** - Now fully integrated
2. ✅ **Authentication Flow Broken** - Complete backend integration
3. ✅ **JWT Token Management** - Secure Keychain storage implemented
4. ✅ **Hardcoded localhost URLs** - Environment-based configuration
5. ✅ **Password Hashing Mismatch** - Backend handles hashing
6. ✅ **No Error Propagation** - Comprehensive error handling
7. ✅ **Data Model Mismatches** - Snake_case conversion implemented
8. ✅ **No Environment Configuration** - AppConfig system in place

### Partially Fixed:
1. 🟡 **Household Management** - Create/join implemented, needs UI updates
2. 🟡 **CloudKit Integration** - Disabled with backend fallback ready

### Still To Fix:
1. 🔴 **Socket.io Client Missing** - Real-time features not implemented
2. 🔴 **No Integration Tests** - Testing framework needed
3. 🔴 **No API Response Validation** - Basic validation only

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### Network Layer Architecture
```swift
NetworkManager (Singleton)
├── JWT Management (Keychain)
├── Auto Token Refresh
├── Network Status Monitor
└── Generic Request Handler
    ├── Auth Endpoints
    ├── Household Endpoints
    └── Task Endpoints
```

### Data Flow Architecture
```
User Action → Local Update → Backend Sync → Confirmation
                    ↓
              Core Data (Offline Storage)
                    ↓
              Sync Queue (Pending Operations)
```

### Sync Strategy
- **Offline First**: All operations work offline
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately
- **Background Sync**: Automatic when online
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins with timestamps
- **Periodic Sync**: Every 60 seconds when online

---

## 📝 Next Steps (Phase 3: Real-time Features)

### 1. Socket.io Integration
```swift
// Need to implement:
- Add Socket.IO-Client-Swift package
- Create SocketManager service
- Connect to backend WebSocket server
- Listen for real-time events
- Update UI on socket events
```

### 2. Real-time Event Handlers
- Task creation/update notifications
- Household member changes
- Leaderboard updates
- Challenge notifications
- Activity feed updates

### 3. UI Integration
- Update views to use IntegratedAuthenticationManager
- Update task views to use IntegratedTaskManager
- Add loading states and error handling
- Add sync status indicators

### 4. Testing Framework
- Unit tests for network layer
- Integration tests for sync logic
- End-to-end tests for user flows
- Mock server for development

## 💡 Technical Decisions Made

1. **Offline-First Architecture**: All features work offline with sync when online
2. **Optimistic UI Updates**: Better UX with immediate feedback
3. **Keychain for Tokens**: Secure storage for JWT tokens
4. **Environment-Based Config**: Easy switching between dev/staging/prod
5. **Automatic Retry**: Network operations retry automatically
6. **Periodic Sync**: Background sync every 60 seconds
