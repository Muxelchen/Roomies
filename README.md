# HouseHero - Advanced iOS Household Management App

A comprehensive, production-ready iOS app for gamified household organization in families and shared living spaces, featuring advanced security, analytics, and system integration.

## 🏠 About the App

HouseHero transforms household management into an engaging, gamified experience. With advanced features like photo verification, biometric security, iOS widgets, calendar integration, and comprehensive analytics, it's the ultimate solution for modern households.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

HouseHero follows a **clean architecture pattern** with clear separation of concerns:

```
HouseHero/
├── 📱 Frontend Layer (UI & User Interaction)
│   ├── Views/                    # SwiftUI Views
│   ├── Widgets/                  # iOS Widgets
│   ├── Assets.xcassets/         # UI Resources
│   └── ContentView.swift        # Main Content View
├── 🔧 Backend Layer (Business Logic & Data)
│   ├── Services/                # Business Logic Managers
│   ├── Models/                  # Data Layer & Core Data
│   └── HouseholdModel.xcdatamodeld/ # Core Data Schema
└── ⚙️ Configuration Layer (App Setup)
    ├── HouseHeroApp.swift       # App Entry Point
    ├── Info.plist              # App Configuration
