## Technical Implementation

### Real-Time Task Operations

```swift
// Task Creation with Real-Time Sync
do {
    try viewContext.save()
    
    // Sync with real-time service
    HouseholdSyncService.shared.syncTaskUpdate(newTask)
    
    // Schedule notifications
    NotificationManager.shared.scheduleTaskReminder(task: newTask)
} catch {
    // Handle errors gracefully
}
```

### Member Management with Live Updates

```swift
// Real-time member removal
private func removeMember(_ member: User) {
    viewContext.delete(membershipToRemove)
    try viewContext.save()
    
    // Sync removal across all devices
    syncService.syncMemberRemoval(
        userId: member.id?.uuidString ?? "",
        householdId: household.id?.uuidString ?? ""
    )
}
```

### Connection Status Management

```swift
// Live connection status in UI
StatisticView(
    title: "Connection",
    value: syncService.isConnected ? "Live" : "Offline",
    icon: syncService.isConnected ? "wifi" : "wifi.slash",
    color: syncService.isConnected ? .green : .orange
)
```
