## üîß Technical Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Node.js + TypeScript** - Runtime and language
- **Express.js** - Web framework
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database
- **Redis** - Caching and sessions

## üì± API Design Principles

### RESTful Standards
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Pagination for list endpoints
- Filtering and sorting support

### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {},
  "message": "Operation successful",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-06T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Error Format
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid input",
    "details": []
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-01-06T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Must Have
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- JWT with refresh tokens
- Input validation
- SQL injection prevention
- Rate limiting
- CORS configuration

### Nice to Have
- Two-factor authentication
- API key for external integrations
- Request signing

## üìà Success Metrics

### Technical

- 99.9% uptime
- Support 1000+ concurrent users
- Real-time updates < 100ms latency

### Functional
